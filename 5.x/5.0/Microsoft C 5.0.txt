Microsoft C 5.0
Released in 1987 by Microsoft
For DOS

This is the original standalone Microsoft C/C++ compiler for DOS and
Windows - Later versions were rebranded and renumbered as Microsoft
Visual C++ and were bundled with Visual Studio or the SDKs.

Notes:

Disks were scanned using ImageDisk running under MS-DOS 6.2 on a
386SX25 computer with a Tandon 360k 40T 5 1/4 inch floppy disk drive.

No errors were reported during the imaging. All disks had their
write-protect covers intact.
